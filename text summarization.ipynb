Martin Luther King Jr. at the “March on Washington,” \\n1963 (excerpts ) \\n \\nI am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for \\nfreedom in the history of our nation. \\nFive score years ago a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the \\nEmancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree is a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro \\nslaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the \\nlong night of their captivity. But 100 years later the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later the \\nlife of the Negro is still badly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. \\nOne hundred years later the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of \\nmaterial prosperity. One hundred years later the Negro is still languished in the corners of American \\nsociety and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful \\ncondition. \\nIn a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our Republic wrote \\nthe magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a \\npromissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men—yes, \\nblack men as well as white men—would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the \\npursuit of happiness. . . . \\nWe must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our \\ncreative protests to degenerate into physical violence. . . . The marvelous new militancy which has \\nengulfed the Negro community must not lead us to distrust all white people, for many of our white \\nbrothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up \\nwith our destiny. \\n. . . We cannot walk alone. And as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. \\nWe cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, “When will you be \\nsatisfied?” We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of \\npolice brutality. \\nWe can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in \\nthe motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. \\nWe cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We \\ncan never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their adulthood and robbed of their dignity \\nby signs stating “For Whites Only.” \\nWe cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and the Negro in New York \\nbelieves he has nothing for which to vote. \\nNo, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and \\nrighteousness like a mighty stream. . . . \\nI say to you today, my friends, though, even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still'),\n",

It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this \\nnation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that \\nall men are created equal.” \\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia sons of former slaves and the sons of former \\nslave-owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day \\neven the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of \\noppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. \\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by \\nthe color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream . . . I have a dream that one \\nday in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of \\ninterposition and nullification, one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able \\nto join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. \\nI have a dream today . . . \\nThis will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with new meaning. “My country, ’tis of \\nthee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim’s pride, from \\nevery mountain side, let freedom ring.” And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. So \\nlet freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty \\nmountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let \\nfreedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of \\nCalifornia. \\nBut not only that. Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia. Let freedom ring from Lookout \\nMountain of Tennessee. Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi, from every \\nmountain side. Let freedom ring . . . \\nWhen we allow freedom to ring—when we let it ring from every city and every hamlet, from every state \\nand every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white \\nmen, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the \\nold Negro spiritual, “Free at last, Free at last, Great God a-mighty, We are free at last.” \\n \\n \\nReprinted by arrangement with The Heirs to the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr., c/o Writers House as the \\nproprietor New York, NY.

       "'##  A Dream of Equality:  King\\'s Vision for America\\n\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech, delivered at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, remains a landmark moment in the fight for racial equality.  King masterfully blends historical context, personal experience, and soaring rhetoric to articulate his vision of a transformed America. Here are the key points of his powerful message:\\n\\n1. **Unfulfilled Promise:** King begins by reminding his audience of the Emancipation Proclamation, highlighting the stark reality that a century later, Black Americans are still denied their fundamental rights and freedoms. \\n2. **Continuing Injustice:** He paints a vivid picture of the daily struggles faced by Black people, including segregation, economic inequality, and systemic discrimination in all aspects of life. \\n3. **Urgency for Change:** King emphasizes the urgency of the movement, framing it as a demand for the full realization of the promises enshrined in the Constitution and Declaration of Independence.  He calls for a nonviolent struggle, urging his followers to remain steadfast in their pursuit of justice.\\n4. **White Allies and Interconnectedness:** He acknowledges the growing support from white allies, emphasizing that the fight for Black liberation is inextricably linked to the pursuit of justice for all Americans. \\n5. **Deep-Seated Grievances:** Through powerful repetition and evocative imagery, King outlines the specific injustices that fuel the movement, from police brutality to the denial of basic rights like voting and access to public accommodations. \\n6. **Vision of Equality:** King paints a hopeful picture of a future where his children will be judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin. He envisions a nation where freedom \"rings\" from every corner, signifying the triumph of equality and justice for all. \\n7. **Commitment to Justice:** King concludes with an unwavering commitment to continuing the fight for equality until justice prevails, leaving his audience with an unforgettable call for a future where all Americans are truly free.\\n\\n\\n\\nKing\\'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech is not just a historical document; it is a timeless call for human dignity, equality, and justice that continues to resonate deeply today. \\n'"
